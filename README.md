## Introduction
Welcome to the `ft_irc` project at 42 Paris! This README provides an overview of the project, its features, and how to get started.

## Project Description
`ft_irc` is a project at 42 that focuses on building an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server and client. Internet Relay Chat is a real-time messaging protocol that enables group communication via text. This project challenges students to design and implement both server and client applications, adhering to the IRC protocol standards. It's an excellent opportunity to gain hands-on experience in network programming, system administration, and software development.

## Features
- **IRC Server**: Implement a fully functional IRC server that can handle multiple clients simultaneously.
- **IRC Client**: Develop an IRC client that can connect to the server, join channels, and send/receive messages.
- **Multi-Channel Support**: Users can create and join multiple chat channels for group communication.
- **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication and access control for secure communication.
- **Command Handling**: Support various IRC commands, such as JOIN, PRIVMSG, MODE, etc.
- **Message History**: Store and retrieve message history for channels and private messages.
